I am very sorry that I did not manage the promised update yet (due to
private tasks). Yes, I hereby state that Fedora has my explicit
permission to release Getopt::ArgvFile 1.11 under Artistic License 2.0.

I am still willing to publish an updated version explicitly licensed
under Artistic License 2.0. Sorry for the delay.

Thank you!
